Demonstration scraper for the "ebook Scraping for Journalists":http://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists

This second scraper tries to address the UTF error in "the previous version":https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/birminghamcouncilexpenditure/ by using the .decode("utf-8") method.

That stops the previous error. Now, however, we get a new error: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa3 in position 1: invalid start byte

But this helps us better identify what our problem is, "in the next version":https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/birminghamcouncilexpenditure_3rd/
